## 1. Introduction
O protocolo proposto é uma mudança relativa ao protocolo HTTP original. Nesta versão de HTTP usaremos, iremos fazer mudanças referentes ao cabeçalho das mensagens de requisição e resposta. Onde nos campos opcionais será inserido o campo Geographic Location  (GPOS) com seus atributos. Tal protocolo servirá para quando for enviada uma requisição HTTP, a mesma retorne com a geolocalização do servidor que respondeu a requisição. Ressaltando que o método utilizado, ou seja, GPOS foi implementado para servidores DNS[RFC 1712].  

## 2. Conventions used in this document
In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.

In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)   indicates a statement using the key words listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying or finding the portions of this RFC covered by these keywords.

## 3. Section 2 heading as appropriate
O novo cabeçalho de requisição e respostas do protocolo HTTP com GPOS é:
1. A requisição GET HTTP terá um novo campo: GPOS: nome_dispositivo
2. A resposta terá o formato: nome_dispositivo ttl class GPOS longitude latitude altitude
