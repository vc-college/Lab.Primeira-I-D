## Abstract

## 1. Introduction
This application provides the latitude, longitude and altitude between ths client and the server.

## 2. Conventions used in this document
In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.

In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)   indicates a statement using the key words listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying or finding the portions of this RFC covered by these keywords.

## 3. Section 2 heading as appropriate
The client application sends the following HEADER
   ```GET <filename> HTTP/1.1 HOST: <host_name> GPOS: <device_name>```,
when the requisition is allowed, the server provides a DNS response with the
GPOS latitude (lat), longidue(lon) altitude (alt) like
```<device_name> <ttl> <class> GPOS <lat> <lon> <alt>```
where
  Latitude is the real number describing the latitude data as a string in range -90..90 degrees. Positives number indicate north of the equator.
  Longitude is the real number describing the latitude data as a string in range -180..180 degrees. Positive number indicate east of the prime meridian.
  Altitude is the real number describing the altitude (meters) from sea-level. positive numver indicate locations above the mean sea-level.
