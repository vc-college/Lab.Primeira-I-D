In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.
